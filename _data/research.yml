      SmQ platform is a new platform for aerial manipulation, 
        which consists of a tool (or frame) with multiple quadrotors 
        connected to that by spherical joints, acting as distributed rotating thrust generators. 
        Lyapunov control design is performed while taking into account the spherical joint limits 
        in a form of real-time constrained optimization.

    We propose a novel control framework 
    to enable a quadrotor to operate a tool attached on it.  
    We fully characterize the internal dynamics of the spatial quadrotor tool operation, 
    which arises due to the quadrotor’s under-actuation, and elucidate a 
    seemingly counter-intuitive necessary condition for the internal stability, 
    that is, the tool-tip should be located above the quadrotor’s center-of-mass. 
    We further manifest that this internal dynamics can exhibit finite-time escape 
    and propose a stabilizing action to prevent that.

      abstract: |
        We propose a novel control framework to enable a quadrotor to
         operate a tool attached on it. We first show that
          any Cartesian control at the tool-tip can be generated 
          if and only if the tool-tip is located strictly above 
          or below the quadrotor’s center-of-mass. We then fully
           characterize the internal dynamics of the spatial quadrotor
            tool operation, which arises due to the quadrotor’s under-actuation
            , and elucidate a seemingly counter-intuitive necessary 
            condition for the internal stability, that is, 
        the tool-tip should be located above the quadrotor’s 
        center-of-mass. We further manifest that this internal
        dynamics can exhibit finite-time escape and propose a 
        stabilizing action to prevent that. The theory is then 
        illustrated for the problems of rotating tool operation 
        and hybrid force/position control with relevant simulation results.
